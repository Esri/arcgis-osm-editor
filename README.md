ArcGIS Editor for OpenStreetMap - Welcome!

ArcGIS Editor for OpenStreetMap is a toolset for GIS users to access and contribute to OpenStreetMap through their ArcGIS Desktop or Server environment.  Learn more at [esri.com/osmeditor](http://www.esri.com/osmeditor).

## Features
* Download data from OSM into a file geodatabase - get data from the current extent or load from an .osm file
* Create your own planet (.osm) files
* Edit OSM data in ArcGIS
* Upload edits back to OSM
* Create routing networks from OSM data
* Create custom feature services based on OSM data

## Instructions
1. To access compiled setups (if you just want to install in ArcGIS and not deal with the code):

	a) Download the repo's .zip file

	b) You can ignore the 'src' folder, that is source code. Open the 'setups' folder and unzip the setup that applies to your ArcGIS Version.
	
	c) Install as described in the http://github.com/Esri/arcgis-osm-editor/wiki/System-requirements%2C-installation%2C-%26-working-with-the-code documentation.
	
	d) Read documentation at http://github.com/Esri/arcgis-osm-editor/wiki/Documentation on how to use the tools

2. If you want to work with the code:
	
	a) Fork and then clone the repo. 
	
	b) See the documentation on working with the code ("Working with the code" section of this topic: http://github.com/Esri/arcgis-osm-editor/wiki/System-requirements,-installation,-&-working-with-the-code).
	
	c) *If you want to work with the Server Component code, then do the following*: 
		1) Please read the web.config to run the server and make sure all paths are correct.
		2) Please make sure you install Visual Studio 2010 Service Pack 1. Best way to know you got the latest of Visual Studio is to install it from here: http://www.microsoft.com/web/gallery/install.aspx?appid=VWDorVS2010SP1Pack
		3) Make sure you have ArcGIS 10.1 installed to run the Server part.
		4) The application needs a SDE connection.You can change in the web.config where the sde file is:
    	 	 add key="DatabaseConnection" value="C:\Data\OSM\Mxds\osmdevsde.sde"

## Requirements

* An OpenStreetMap login (create at https://www.openstreetmap.org/user/new)
* ArcGIS for Desktop 10.1 (Desktop Component)
* ArcGIS Server 10.1, ArcSDE 10.1, and IIS (Server Component)
